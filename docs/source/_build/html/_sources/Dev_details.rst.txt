===================
Development details
===================
Hello. This is the development details for TADA application.

About Streamlit framework
==========================
Streamlit is an open-source app framework for Machine Learning and Data Science teams. This framework makes it easy to create and share beautiful, custom web apps for machine learning and data science, all in pure Python.

The way Streamlit works is : 
Any time something must be updated on the screen, Streamlit just **reruns the entire Python script from top to bottom**.


Description of mudules
=======================

TADA interface module
-----------------------
class StInterface
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This class displays Streamlit user Interface. The prefix « St » stands for Streamlit. This class imports Streamlit framework. We also import SessionState class to keep track of the user session. The SessionState class allows us to store data about current state as the user navigates through web pages of this application. At the beginning of the script, we call SessionState.get function. This function create a SessionState object if necessary, or returns the previously created state object. Therefore, when the whole application launches the first time,  since there is not an existing SessionState object, this function will create a SessionState object. At the end of the script, we update the fields of this SessionState object. Because whenever there is a user action, the script rerun from begin to end, so, at the end of the script, the new information will be stored in the SessionState object. Whenever the user clicks a button, SessionState.get function will return the only instance that is generated when the app launches. We can use this object field to track information of the previous state.

class DataStorage
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This class stores global variables, which we don’t want lose them during every user action. Like StInterface, we create an instance of DataStorage when app launches and store it in the SessionState object at the end of the script.
